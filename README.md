# Quantitative-Finance: Portfolio Risk Management

## Introduction
Portfolio risk management is a critical process for investors who want to maximize returns while minimizing the likelihood and impact of negative events. In this README, we will discuss some of the common metrics used in portfolio risk management.

### Value at Risk (VaR)
Value at Risk (VaR) is a commonly used metric that estimates the maximum loss an investment portfolio could incur over a given time period at a given level of confidence. For example, a VaR of 5% for a portfolio of $1 million means that there is a 5% chance that the portfolio could lose more than $50,000 over the next day or week.

### Expected Shortfall (ES)
Expected Shortfall (ES), also known as Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), is another commonly used metric that estimates the expected loss of an investment portfolio beyond the VaR. ES provides a more accurate estimate of potential losses during periods of extreme market volatility.

### Maximum Drawdown
Maximum Drawdown is a metric that measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value over a given period. It is an important metric for investors because it provides an estimate of the maximum loss that could be incurred during a market downturn.

### Beta
Beta is a metric that measures the sensitivity of an investment portfolio to changes in the overall market. A beta of 1.0 indicates that the portfolio moves in lockstep with the market, while a beta of less than 1.0 indicates that the portfolio is less volatile than the market and a beta greater than 1.0 indicates that the portfolio is more volatile than the market.

### Alpha
Alpha is a metric that measures the excess return of an investment portfolio compared to its benchmark. A positive alpha indicates that the portfolio has outperformed its benchmark, while a negative alpha indicates underperformance.

### Sharpe Ratio
Sharpe Ratio is a metric that measures the excess return of an investment portfolio compared to the risk-free rate, adjusted for the portfolio's volatility. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates that the portfolio is generating higher returns for a given level of risk.

### Treynor Ratio
Treynor Ratio is a metric that measures the excess return of an investment portfolio compared to its beta, adjusted for the portfolio's volatility. A higher Treynor Ratio indicates that the portfolio is generating higher returns for a given level of systematic risk.

### Sortino Ratio
Sortino Ratio is a metric that measures the excess return of an investment portfolio compared to its downside risk, adjusted for the portfolio's volatility. A higher Sortino Ratio indicates that the portfolio is generating higher returns for a given level of downside risk.

### Correlation Coefficient
Correlation Coefficient is a metric that measures the degree of association between two investment assets or portfolios. A correlation coefficient of 1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation, while a coefficient of -1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation. A coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation.

### Standard Deviation
Standard Deviation is a metric that measures the dispersion of investment returns around the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates that the returns are more spread out and therefore more volatile.

### Covariance
Covariance is a metric that measures the degree to which two investment assets or portfolios move together. A positive covariance indicates that the assets move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates that the assets move in opposite directions.

### Correlation Matrix
A Correlation Matrix is a table that shows the correlation coefficients between multiple investment assets or portfolios. It is a useful tool for identifying the relationships between different investments and managing portfolio risk.

### Scenario Analysis
Scenario Analysis is a risk management technique that involves analyzing the potential impact of different market scenarios on an investment portfolio. By simulating different market conditions, investors can better understand the risks
